# global_temperature_variations
A project to plot the variations in Global Average Temperature from 1880 - 2021 on a chart with chart.js

The chart is a simple demonstration of the variations in the global average temperature from the yaer 1880 to 2021 as per the data downloaded from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) website

This project presents changes in average temperature in five(5) categories.These are:

1. Mean Global Temperature
2. Temperature at the Northern Hemisphere
3. Temperature at the Southern Hemisphere
4. Temperature at 24° north of the equator, and
5. Temperature at 24° south of the equator
To see the variation in the temperature of any of the regions, you will click on the corresponding button above.

As can be seen from the charts, the average temperature of the world is constantly rising. This is the effect of global warming.

Like such, actions need to be taken to stop or slow down this process of gradual rise in the global temperature.
